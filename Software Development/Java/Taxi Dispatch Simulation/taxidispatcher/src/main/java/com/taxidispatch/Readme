# Taxi Dispatch Simulation

This project is a Java-based simulation of a taxi dispatching system. It uses JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI) and provides a simulation of taxi dispatching, client requests, and statistics tracking.

## Features

- **Taxi Dispatching**: Simulates the dispatching of taxis to client requests based on availability and location.
- **Client Requests**: Generates random client requests for taxi pickups and drop-offs.
- **Statistics Tracking**: Tracks and displays dispatch statistics, including the number of trips between different areas.
- **Simulation Control**: Allows starting and stopping the simulation, as well as adjusting the rate of client requests.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface using JavaFX.

### Key Files

- **TaxiServiceDispatchingSystem.java**: The main class that initializes and runs the simulation.
- **DispatchCenter.java**: Manages taxis and handles dispatching logic.
- **Taxi.java**: Represents a taxi with attributes like availability and destination.
- **ClientRequest.java**: Represents a client request with pickup and drop-off locations.
- **DispatchStatsDialog.java**: Displays dispatch statistics in a dialog.

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- JavaFX 13 or higher

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd taxidispatcher

2. Build the project using Maven:
    mvn clean install

3. Run the application:
    mvn javafx:run

## Usage
Start Simulation: Use the "Start Clients Coming" option in the "Simulation" menu to begin generating client requests.

Stop Simulation: Use the "Stop Clients From Coming" option to pause client generation.

Adjust Simulation Rate: Use the "Simulation Rate ..." option in the "Settings" menu to set the rate of client requests.

View Statistics: Use the "Statistics" option in the "Admin" menu to view dispatch statistics.

## Future Enhancements 
Here are some potential improvements that could be made to the project:

1. Dynamic Area Management: Allow users to add or remove areas dynamically.
2. Improved Dispatch Logic: Implement more advanced algorithms for taxi dispatching, such as considering traffic conditions or prioritizing certain requests.
3. Real-Time Map Integration: Integrate a map to visualize taxi movements and client requests.
4.Logging and Reporting: Add functionality to log dispatch events and generate detailed reports.
